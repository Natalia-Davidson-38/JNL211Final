      <p class="caption">The cost of groceries in New York State is 3.8% above the national average, the fifth highest rate behind Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont. The estimated cost of groceries for a family of four in NYS is $215 per week.</p>

      <p>An estimated 13% of American households have faced food insecurity in the past year. This means that one in eight households and one in five children have struggled to meet their nutritional needs according to the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/key-statistics-graphics/">U.S Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA).</p>

      <p>Ryan Healy, advocacy manager for the Feeding New York State non-profit organization shared what he believes to be the two biggest misconceptions surrounding food insecurity across New York State.</p>

      <p>“The first error is that it affects a relatively small number of people and the other is that we don’t know what to do about it,” said Healy.</p>

      <p>New York State has a population of nearly 20 million people. Of those 20 million, almost 3 million people in the state were registered participants in the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps.</p>

      <p>SNAP is widely regarded as one of the most impactful nutritional support programs across the country. SNAP provides lower-income or eligible families with money that can be spent on nutritional foods. The federal government pays for the cost of SNAP benefits, but defers the role of administration and the organization of operations to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. SNAP’s broader eligibility requirements are set at the federal level, but individual states have the ability to make minor adjustments. In Florida a household in possession of a vehichle will not recieve as many benefits as someone without one, but Pennsylvania does not take vehicles into account when determining benefits.</p>

      <p>The basic parameters for SNAP benefits require a gross monthly income consistently under the poverty line, income after deductions including housing costs or child care must be below or equal to the poverty line, or assets to fall below predetermined limits, a protection the primarily protects those who are 60 years old or people living with disabilities.</p>

      <p>SNAP aims to protect families, or households who purchase and eat meals together, including College Students. A study conducted by Temple University in 2019 found that nearly 45% of SUNY and CUNY students were food insecure.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth Barlow, an administrative assistant at Feeding New York State, blames increasing cost of living, inflation, and rising tuition costs as a few reasons for the high rates of food insecure students living in New York State.</p>

      <p>As businesses closed and people lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, people who had already been SNAP participants before the pandemic lost an average of $80 a month, a significant amount of money considering that an estimated 60% of households live paycheck to paycheck and are unable to afford a $500 emergency. The federal government responded by passing emergency allotments that made subsidies and relief packages more available and substantial.</p>

      <p>With the additional fudning passed in the midst of the pandemic, SNAP responded by lowering requirements. The three month waiting period before SNAP relief issuance was waived and the amount of money given was raised. Money given to qualifying community members was based on a USDA reassessment that recalculated the expected cost of food in New York State in 2021. The Department of Social Services in New York State reported that the average SNAP participant would consequently receive $6 a day, amounting to about $180 a month exclusively available to be spent on food, a $35 increase from before the USDA’s reassessment. These increased benefits resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of households facing food insecurity in New York State until March of this year. The Urban Institute reported that pandemic related changes to SNAP lifted over 400 thousand New Yorkers out of poverty.</p>

      <p>This past March, the increased federal funding for SNAP programs received through pandemic related relief funding was cut. The average SNAP participant saw an average loss of about $150, an 83% decrease from when the federal government had increased social benefit programs during the pandemic. Consequently, the number of people facing food insecurity saw the greatest jump since 2008, the first year of the Great Recession. The increase in people facing food insecurity offsets a downward trend that has lasted well over a decade.</p>

      <p>“It’s just sort of unrealistic to envision a society in which there is no safety net for people who are struggling,” said Heally. “SNAP alone isn’t going to eradicate hunger, poverty, or food insecurity; it’s a tool. It’s one of many tools that we have as a society. Is it a perfect tool? No. Does it do a good job of lifting folks who are struggling? Yes. Are there too many barriers? Yes. Are the benefit levels too low? Also yes.”</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/New_York?g=040XX00US36">U.S. Census Bureau</a> (USCB) found that poverty rates are at an estimated 25% per capita in Central and Upstate New York. Central and Upstate New York were, for the larger part of the 19th century into the early 20th century, the industrial backbone for the state during the Industrial Revolution. Since then, the region has faced outsourcing of jobs, population decline, and stagnant wages.</p>

      <p>The USCB released a list of the 25 cities across the country with the highest percentage of people dependent on SNAP benefits. Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse were all included in the list.</p>

      <p>Upward of 44 million people across the U.S. face hunger. It is an issue with even more relevance in Central and Upstate New York where an estimated one in four people live in poverty according to the <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/reports/new-yorkers-need-look-poverty-trends-new-york-state-last-decade#:~:text=In%20Syracuse%2C%20Rochester%20and%20Buffalo,were%20in%20poverty%20in%202021.">NYS Comptroller.</a></p>

      <p>When asked what individuals could do to support their own community members struggling from food insecurity, Barlow stressed the importance of hands-on assistance. Volunteering at food banks, working with local food pantries, and supporting local food assistance related legislations are all ways to help combat food insecurity.</p>
